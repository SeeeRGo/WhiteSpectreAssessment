Hi! I thought that adding a little clarification added to my code would be helpful. In total I spent about 2,5 hours on the task with main part taking around 2 hours and tidying up taking somewhat 30 minutes.

I used plain React without any additional UI libraries, with typescript. Setup is made with webpack. Styling is made with inline styles I felt that this was sufficient for the task given. Right now it's a barebones project based on the assumption that I shouldn't spend excessive amounts of time and that functionality should be prioritized over making it look prettier than basic browser components.

Some ideas that I could've implemented in more "realistic" circumstances:
 - use media queries or some other mechanism to have breakpoints and display less cards, on smaller screens
 - custom styling for components and elements
 - more elegant logic for showing and hiding individual items

To start the project: 
- unzip the archive
- run npm/yarn install
- run npm/yarn start
- open localhost:3000 in your browser
